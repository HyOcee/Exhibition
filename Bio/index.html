<p>1. Genetic code is not unique. It is nearly universal.It is the same in Humans, Plants, Amphibians and Viruses. It consists of 64 triplets of nucleotides that code for 20 amino acids. Eacch triplet is known as a Codon. As there are 64 codons, and only 20 amino acids, a single amino acid can be coded by more than one codon (Degeneracy). However, a single codon always codes for one particular amino acid (Non-Ambiguity).</p>

<p>The genetic code is non overlapping i.e. after reading one triplet, the reading frame shifts to the other three nucleotides</p>
<p>The genetic code is coma less i.e. no extra nucleotide between the codons.</p>
<p>AUG is usually a start codon that codes for methainine <br>
UAA, UAG  and  UGA are stop codons</p>

<p>A tRNA molecule has an "L" structure held together by hydrogen bonds between bases in different parts of the tRNA sequence. One end of the tRNA binds to a specific amino acid (amino acid attachment site) and the other end has an anticodon that will bind to an mRNA codon.

Transfer RNA is the third main type of RNA and one of the smallest, usually only 70–90 nucleotides long. It carries the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis in the ribosome. It is the base pairing between the tRNA and mRNA that allows for the correct amino acid to be inserted in the polypeptide chain being synthesized (Figure 4). Any mutations in the tRNA or rRNA can result in global problems for the cell because both are necessary for proper protein synthesis

<p>The structure of a mature eukaryotic mRNA. A fully processed mRNA includes a 5' cap, 5' UTR, coding region, 3' UTR, and poly(A) tail. mRNA genes are the genes that encode only for proteins but this encoding has an RNA intermediate

Nucleotides at the 5′ end provide binding sites for proteins that initiate polypeptide synthesis; nucleotides in the middle specify the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide; and nucleotides at the 3′ end regulate the stability of the mRNA (Fig. 1.1).

The mRNA carries the message from the DNA, which controls all of the cellular activities in a cell. If a cell requires a certain protein to be synthesized, the gene for this product is “turned on” and the mRNA is synthesized through the process of transcription (see RNA Transcription). The mRNA then interacts with ribosomes and other cellular machinery (Figure 3) to direct the synthesis of the protein it encodes during the process of translation (see Protein Synthesis). mRNA is relatively unstable and short-lived in the cell, especially in prokaryotic cells, ensuring that proteins are only made when needed.

<p>Ribosomes consist of two major components: the small and large ribosomal subunits. Each subunit consists of one or more ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules and many ribosomal proteins (RPs or r-proteins). The ribosomes and associated molecules are also known as the translational apparatus.

Ribosomes are composed of rRNA and protein. As its name suggests, rRNA is a major constituent of ribosomes, composing up to about 60% of the ribosome by mass and providing the location where the mRNA binds. The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA, tRNA, and the ribosomes; the rRNA of the ribosome also has an enzymatic activity (peptidyl transferase) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids during protein synthesis.
